# NEOExchange Observations Planner
This GitHub repository contains all relevant files and outputs relating to this project, which is an observation planner and object visibility plotter, optimised for NEOExchange objects (https://neoexchange.lco.global/).

## Synopsis

This repository contains a template Jupyter notebook, which can be forked for your personal needs. This notebook contains code for retrieving and displaying information on NEOExchange astronomical objects (https://neoexchange.lco.global/). It is intended to be used as an observation planner and object visibility plotter.

## Code Example

See `NEOExchange-Obs-Planner.ipynb`.

## Motivation

When observing small bodies such as comets and asteroids, vital information such as target brightness, rising/setting times, visibility of moon, etc. are required in order to make careful decisions when planning an observation run. I built this code for my own needs when observing on the University of Canterbury Mt. John Observatory's 1.8-metre telescope, however realized that this code can be used by other astronomers who wish to observe small bodies. My code has even been adapted by CheerfulUser (https://github.com/CheerfulUser/mjo_staralt) as a pip-installable package.

## Installation

Fork the Jupyter notebook `NEOExchange-Obs-Planner.ipynb` and change the variables where directed.
`sample_targets.txt` is a sample text file demonstrating the formatting of the input target list. Input your targets in a similar manner.
